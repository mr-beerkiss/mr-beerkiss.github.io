# Main Header

Here is just some plain text

* This 
* is 
* a 
* List

Here is an inline code example `run me` hopefully it works for you (because it does for me!)


## Small Heading ##

The most banal code ever written:

{% highlight javascript %}
function helloWorld() {
    console.log("Hello world!");
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Smaller heading

The best phone ever made (warning: Flame-bait)

#### How much smaller can these heading get?

How about a good ol' block quote:

> I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.
>
> <cite>&mdash; Nelson Mandela</cite>

That's odd.
