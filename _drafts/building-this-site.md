Cool way have nav items set to active automatically http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8340170/jekyll-automatically-highlight-current-tab-in-menu-bar

Too bad the above method doesn't allow you to order the pages, but you following Ámon Tamás' suggestion (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13266369/how-to-change-the-default-order-pages-in-jekyll/28127023#28127023?newreg=2605933123a2470ebd769eea43ed115a) I was able to specify the order in a separate page.  It won't be nice to main a separate list of urls but since the site is small 
it _probably_ will be fine.

I also stared using Emmet with this project and man oh man is it awesome!
