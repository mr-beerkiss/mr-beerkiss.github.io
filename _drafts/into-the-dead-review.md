Wasn't looking for a game, now addicted

Beautiful art style

Well designed, good difficulty curve and reward system

Issues with micro transactions. Full unlock? Coin doubler? Weapon upgrades via in-game currency

Ideas for updates; pay to switch all real money to in-game money. Permanent perks (eg ammo-saver: retain unused ammo when picking up a new crate); separate weapon slot for grenades

Overall very happy with gameplay but disappointed by greedy implementation of micro transactions.
