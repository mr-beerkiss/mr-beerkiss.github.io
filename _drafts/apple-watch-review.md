# The Unintended Consequence of Innovation

##Â A review of the Apple Watch

I've been wearing my Apple Watch for just over a month now and overall I am suitably impressed.  Certainly more so than I was upgrading from an iPhone 5 to and iPhone 6 but that perhaps is a story for another day.

What has struck me most about it so far is the social impact it has had in my every day life.  The primary issue is that checking one's watch indicates to others that the wearer is time-sensitive or rushed to be somewhere else and it sends a strong message to others not to waste that time.  Since the Apple Watch is more than just a watch the wearer is much more likely to check it for notifications.  The haptic feedback is paints a tempting picture for the user to check their watch.  Most of us have been exposed to smart phones long enough now to know that it certain circumstances you should ignore these notifications and focus on the social engagement at hand.  But with the watch it's such a simple thing to twist your wrist and raise your arm ever so slightly to see what was indicated by that suitable vibration on your wrist.  I wonder if the Apple Designers ever considered the effect that the Apple Watch may have on social encounters where checking a phone for a notification may be considered socially acceptable but checking ones watch and the implied action of boredom is not.

I invested in an Apple Watch primarily for lifestyle/health motivations and also because Apple's marketing is so damned stylish it's difficult to not be impressed by their particular breed of consumer propaganda.  As a proponent of technological innovation I was keen to move fitness and lifestyle data into the technological sphere so that the data could be easily mapped and analysed to help me recognise what was working what wasn't and to find areas to improve on.

My preference at the time was for the FitBit.  I'd done very shallow research into it and found it favourable to the Jawbone Up.  I'm ummmed and ahhhed about it for a few months and decided to stick to greasy burgers and beers for the mean time instead.

After these months I spied my sideways profile and thought it was time to dust off the old running shoes and health cook books and try reverse my current trend of net calorie intake.  

After a few weeks of running and eating better I hit my healthy stride but I wanted more data to help me improve.  Thus was revived my desire for some form of digital fitness tracking.  However this time around the Apple Watch's launch was imminent so many of the comparisons I had previously looked at had been amended to include the Apple Watch.

The Apple Watch won me over in the end because it could do everything the FitBit and Jawbone Up could do and more.  You had access to Maps, Siri, Music and even short-cuts for dealing with texts, emails and phone calls.  Additionally, since I am something of an Apple fan (iPhone-iPad-iMac-TV-gotta-collect-em-all) I thought my purchase of an Apple Watch was inevitable so instead of buying two things I would just buy one.

So what have I used it for?  Most just the
