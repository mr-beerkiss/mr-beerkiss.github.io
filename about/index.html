<h1>About</h1>
<h2>The longer version</h2>
<p>
When I first started writing covering letters my late father told me not to write a Louis L'Amour novel so with that in mind I'll be as brief and concise as possible.  Besides, if you're interested in my writing style or just ranting in general please check out my <a href="/blog/">Blog</a>.
</p>
<p>
I was born and raised in South Africa.  I received a diploma with honours in Computer Science (Programming Languages) from CTI College in Randburg.  Unfortunately for me no one outside of South Africa seems to be aware of this particular institution nor hold its qualification in any kind of esteem.  However <em>I did</em> learn to write good code and promptly fell in love with the artistry that is computer science.
</p>
<p>
I moved to the UK in 2006 and after a brief stint Reading I made my way to London in 2008 and have been living and loving it ever since.  I've had a variety of jobs since basing my career in the UK.  Most of them were mobile focussed but since the release of the iPhone the differeniation between desktop and mobile has become increasingly blurred.  Thanks to node.js and it's ilk the line between backend and frontend development has also blurred significantly.
</p>
<p>
I now find myself under the curious label of 'full-stack' developer.  I can write backend code and expose it to the beauitfilly styled front-ends with restful API services.  Heck I can even through in Canvas drawing and WebAudioAPI just for kicks.
</p>
<p>
I spend my professional timing building games but I'm starting to apn
<p>ch out into web applications as well.  I'm also eager to keep up to date with the latest trends and pattern which is challenging today to say the least in todays high-speed internet world.  Thankfully I have not been compelled to write my own framework, even ironically.
</p>
<p>
Coding side, I enjoy music, travelling, TV &amp; film, music, reading, cooking and most of the regular stuff you would expect to find on someone's dating profile.  I know I mentioned music twice since it's probably the only thing I might enjoy more than writing code.  Although music is a much more fickle mistress and our relationship is a tumlutous one.
